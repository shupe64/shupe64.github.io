### WORK IN PROGRESS

By default, RStudio is pretty bland. The bright white background can be hard to look at for long periods of time. While you could change to one of RStudio's built-in themes, creating your own would allow you much more freedom to design it how you like.

# Themes in RStudio

To see the built-in themes, go to "Global Options" under the "Tools" tab and select "Appearance"

Editor themes provide the most customization by changing the colors of RStudio. You can see previews of each editor theme to the right. These editor themes are saved as .rstheme files in RStudio's directory. For me, this is
C:\Program Files\RStudio\resources\app\resources\themes
but it might be different for you depending on where RStudio was installed.

# Customizing Themes

The easiest way to create a custom theme is to copy a built-in .rstheme file and edit it. You can edit these files with any text editor. 

Pick your favorite editor theme, copy it, and rename it. Then, you can open it with any text editor.

This is what textmate.rstheme (the default theme) looks like:

This file is simply all the parameters of the theme. Let's say you wanted functions like "if" to show up red instead of blue. You would search the .rstheme file for:

`.ace_keyword`

and change the color from blue to red.

Making the keywords a different color from numeric characyers improves readability. Here's some other useful paramters to change:

`.ace_editor {background-color: #FFFFFF}` lets you change the background color of the editor window

`.ace_constant` affects constants like `TRUE` and `FALSE`

`.ace_constant.ace_numeric`: affects numbers

`.ace_keyword.ace_operator`: affects things like parentheses, brackets, and other mathematical symbols

You only really need to change what you want. If there's any parameter that you are unsure of, you can find a list of other parameters at "https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/appearance.html"
